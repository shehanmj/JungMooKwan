            <p>Master Chung had received advanced dan rankings from the Chung Do Kwan and the Oh Do Kwan after many years of training in South Korea in Korean Karate (originally called Kong Soo Do and Tang Soo, 
            and later known as Tae Kwon Do), and in Hap Ki Do, and was ranked as an 8th dan at his retirement.</p> <p>The Jung Moo Kwan ("righteous martial arts institute") in the United States offered instruction 
            in Tae Kwon Do and Hap Ki Do. Master Chung's organization in the U.S. was known as Universal Consolidated Martial Arts Jung Moo Kwan, and the Jung Moo Kwan has been listed by the World KiDo 
            Federation of South Korea as one of thirty-one authentic kwans certified to teach traditional Korean martial arts.</p></article></div>

                and later as the original version of Tae Kwon Do (generally known today as “Classic Tae Kwon Do”). In addition to the influence of Okinawan Karate, Korean Karate is also heavily influenced 
                by the indigenous Korean martial arts of Su Bak and Taek Kyon. Jung Moo Kwan Hap Ki Do in the United States as taught by Master Chung has descended from the Seong Moo Kwan and the Shin Moo Kwan.</article></div><br />
